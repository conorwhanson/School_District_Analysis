## School_District_Analysis

# Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to compile, clean, and analyze school district data from 15 schools. During this project, however, information came to light that required the removal of 9th grade reading and math scores from Thomas High School. Once this was done, all data was recalculated.

# Results
- The district summart was not substantially affected because the data removed was a small range within the overall dataset. 
- The school summary was also not substantially affect by the removed data.
- Thomas High School remains one of the top performing schools even after the removal of the data.
- Removing the 9th grade scores for Thomas High School does not affect the other score comparisons by grade.
- The scores by school size rose slightly since the pool of students from which to calculate averages had shrunk (by removing the untrustworthy data).

# Summary
The changes in the overall data were not substantial. However, there were some minor changes
